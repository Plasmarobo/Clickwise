Clickwise
=========

I love Penny-Arcade's Automata. 
When I found out that someone had begun decyphering Clickwise (specifically Clocktalk)...
Well, I decided that I'd like a simple program to print the characters, and...

Maybe even imagine how they sound?
This is my interpretation of the language.
